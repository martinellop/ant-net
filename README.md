## AntNet
AntNet is a stochastic routing algorithm based on the idea "AntHocNet" for mobile, dynamic networks (original paper included in the repository).
This project aims in being a possible, effictive  NetLogo implementation of the original idea. 
The __ant foraging__ mechanism is a collective, natural behaviour which emerges in ant colonies, and which manifests intelligence signs at system level. This mechanism enables ants to find their way to food/nest, and to converge rapidly toward the shortest path available, even in dynamic contexts.
This project is part of the exam for the course "Distributed Artificial Intelligence" @ UniMoRe, Corso di laurea magistrale in Ingegneria informatica.
