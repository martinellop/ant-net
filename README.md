## AntNet
AntNet is a stochastic routing algorithm based on the idea "AntHocNet" for mobile, dynamic networks.
It is based on an collective behaviour which emerges in nature, the __ant foraging__ mechanism.
This project is part of the exam for the course "Distributed Artificial Intelligence" @ UniMoRe, Corso di laurea magistrale in Ingegneria informatica.
